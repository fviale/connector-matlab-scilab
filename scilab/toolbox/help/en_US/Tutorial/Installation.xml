        <title>Downloading and Installing ProActive Scilab Toolbox and ProActive Scheduler</title>
        <para>Scilab Connector Toolbox can be downloaded from :
            <ulink url="http://www.activeeon.com/community-downloads">http://www.activeeon.com/community-downloads
            </ulink>
            and will be soon available on ATOMS.
            The packages which must be downloaded are called Scilab_Connector(if not downloaded from ATOMS) and
            ProActive Scheduling Server Full (e.g. <literal>ProActiveScheduling-3.3.1_bin_full.zip</literal>)
        </para>
        <para>
            After the packages are downloaded, unzip them in a directory e.g. D:\Scilab_Connector and
            D:\ProActive_Scheduling_server
        </para>
        <para>
            According to your deployment infrastructure,

        <para>The prerequisite for using the ProActive Scheduler is a<emphasis>Java Virtual Machine</emphasis>. On the
            above list, machines must
            have a Java Virtual Machine installed and available on the Path of either cmd.exe for Windows or sh for
            linux. For many
            ProActive features it is also necessary to define the environment variable
            <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal>
            to the installation directory of
            the Java Virtual Machine.

        <title>Automatic Configurations</title>
        <refsection>
            <title>Automatic search of Scilab installations for workers</title>
            <para>In the typical utilisation of the toolbox, no configuration of the worker host will be necessary for
                Scilab. When a scilab
                task is waiting to be executed on a scheduler worker, a script will be executed to locate automatically
                scilab on the host.
            </para>
            <para>
                The script will search for scilab in typical locations in both windows and linux environments and will
                write the scilab installations found in a configuration file which will be stored on the host. If no scilab installation
                is found, then the configuration file will be empty and the host will be assumed not to contain any scilab.
            </para>
            <para>Subsequent executions of
                Scilab will reuse this configuration file to decide whether a scilab task can be executed on the host or
                not (though
                it is possible to force a scilab research via execution options, see option

        <refsection>
            <title>Automatic download of Scilab Connector libraries into the Scheduler</title>
            <para>When the Scilab Connector creates jobs understandable by the ProActive Scheduler, it will transfer
                along the ProActive
                Scilab Connector libraries that will be used by the scheduler worker in order to create Scilab engines.
                Those libraries
                are not installed in the ProActive Scheduler by default.
            </para>
            <para>
                This transfer is done via the option<emphasis>UseJobClassPath</emphasis>. If this option is set to
                false, then no transfer will be done,
                and the librairies will have to be copied manually on the scheduler server and workers installations.

        <title>Manual Configurations</title>
        <refsection>
            <title>Manual configuration of Scilab installations for workers</title>
            <para>It may happen though that on some hosts, Scilab is not installed in a typical location and the
                automatic script doesn't manage to find it. In that case it will be necessary to write a Scilab configuration file manually.
            </para>
            <para>A sample configuration file is located inside the
                <emphasis>Scilab_Connector/scheduler-plugin</emphasis>
                folder under the name ScilabWorkerConfiguration.xml
            </para>
            <para>This file must be edited and put inside the
                <emphasis>addons</emphasis>
                directory of ProActive Scheduler. This must be done on ProActive Scheduler Server and on
                every hosts that will be used as Scilab workers for which the automatic configuration didn't work.
            </para>
            <para>If the scheduler is installed in a single directory shared by all workers (via NFS for example), then
                only one ScilabWorkerConfiguration.xml
                file needs to be edited. The syntax of the file allows to create a configuration for several machine
                groups via wildcards
                that will match a machine's hostname or ipaddress, and as well several scilab installations for the same
                machine.
            </para>
            <para>Here is an example of ScilabWorkerConfiguration.xml :</para>
            <para>On each worker host that will be used to compute remotely scilab functions, a specific configuration
                file must be written to tell the scheduler where to find a scilab installation. The configuration file
                is called<emphasis>ScilabWorkerConfiguration.xml</emphasis>, and a template is located in the folder
                <emphasis>Scilab_Connector/toolbox/config</emphasis>.
            </para>
            <para>This file must be edited and put in the
                <emphasis>addons</emphasis>
                directory of ProActive Scheduler
            </para>
            <para>If the scheduler is installed in a directory shared by all workers, then only one
                ScilabWorkerConfiguration.xml file needs to be created. The syntax of the file allows to create a
                configuration for several machines, machine groups, and as well several scilab installations for the
                same machine.
            </para>
