  Syntax
 
        &gt;&gt; options = <span class="helptopic">PAoptions</span>();
        &gt;&gt; <span class="helptopic">PAoptions</span>(param,value, ...);
 
  Inputs
 
        param - a string containing the parameter name
        value - the new value of this parameter
 
  Outputs
 
        options - a structure with fields corresponding to parameters
        names, containing all options values.
 
  Description
        
        <span class="helptopic">PAoptions</span> sets options used by the next PAsolve call. A structure
        containing the current options can be retrieved by calling
        <span class="helptopic">PAoptions</span> with no parameter.
 
  Example
 
        &gt;&gt; <span class="helptopic">PAoptions</span>('Debug', true);
        &gt;&gt; r = PAsolve(@factorial, 1, 2, 3, 4)  % Runs PAsolve in "Debug"
        mode.
 
  Parameters
 
    JobName
                Name of the job that will be submitted to the Scheduler
 
    JobDescription
                Description of the job that will be submitted to the scheduler
 
    Debug               true | false | 'on' | 'off'
 
                Debug mode, default to 'off'
 
 
    TransferEnv       true | false | 'on' | 'off'
 
                Transfers the environment in which the PAsolve/PAeval function is called
                to every remote tasks. Variables transferred this way need to be accessed inside the submitted function
                via the evalin('caller', ...) syntax. Global variables are also transferred and can be accessed normally via the "global" keyword
                default to 'off'
    EnvExcludeList       
                Comma separated list of variables which should be
                excluded from the workspace when transferring the
                environment (TransferEnv)
    EnvExcludeTypeList
                Comma separated list of object types which should be
                excluded from the workspace when transferring the
                environment (TransferEnv)
 
    NbTaskExecution         integer &gt;= 1
                Defines how many times a task can be executed (in case of error),
                it defaults to 2, to limit accidental crash of the remote engine due to memory limitations
 
    Fork        true | false | 'on' | 'off'
                Runs the tasks in a separate JVM process
 
    RunAsMe     true | false | 'on' | 'off'
                Runs the tasks under the account of the current user, default to 'off'
 
    RemoveJobAfterRetrieve     true | false | 'on' | 'off'
                Removes the job automatically after all results have been
                retrieved. If the options is "off", the job is removed at the end of the
                matlab session, or manually via PAjobRemove. default to
                'on'
 
    LicenseSaverURL           char
                URL of the FlexNet LicenseSaver proxy. The LicenseSaver must be downloaded, installed and run separately
                from the scheduler or from ProActive Matlab toolbox. Please send an email contact@activeeon.com .
                The License Saver interacts with an existing FlexNet server to grab information about available Matlab and
                Matlab toolboxes tokens. A Matlab task running inside ProActive Scheduler and connected to a LicenseSaver
                will use tokens only when available, and will remain pending if no token is available.
                If this configuration option is empty, no license check will be done.
 
    CustomDataspaceURL        char
                URL of the dataspace (both input and output) to expose, if
                you don't want to rely on ProActive's automatic transfer
                protocol. The dataspace server must of course be started
                and configure manually in that case. e.g
                <a href="ftp://myserver/rootpath">ftp://myserver/rootpath</a>
 
    CustomDataspacePath       char
                Path to the root of the Custom Dataspace provided by
                CustomDataspaceURL. For example if <a href="ftp://myserver/rootpath">ftp://myserver/rootpath</a>
                is the URL of the Dataspace and the rootpath directory
                corresponds on the file system to /user/myserver/.../root
                then this path must be specified in CustomDataspacePath.
 
    SharedPushPublicUrl, SharedPullPublicUrl, SharedPushPrivateUrl, SharedPullPrivateUrl and SharedAutomaticTransfer    char &amp; boolean
                those url are those used by the Shared DataSpace on the scheduler (if it's activated on the scheduler).
                The Push urls define the spaces where task input files are pushed to. The Pull urls are the spaces from
                which task output files are pulled. The public urls are accessible from anywhere, the private urls are
                accessible only by worker nodes. Contact the scheduler administrator to know these values. Both url (public and private)
                can be equal, but if the infrastucture allows it, it is more efficient to use a file url as private,
                the computing nodes will then access the space directly via a shared file system like NFS
                The option SharedAutomaticTransfer is an internal option and should not be modified.
 
    TransferMatFileOptions    char
                If TranferEnv is set to on, tells which options are used to save the local environment
                See the "save" command for more information. Default to
                '-v7'
 
    VersionPref       char
                Determines the matlab version preferred to use by the worker, e.g. 7.5
 
    VersionRej        char
                A string containing a list of matlab versions that must not be used, delimiters can be spaces or commas : 7.5, 7.7
 
    VersionMin        char
                A minimum matlab version that can be used
 
    VersionMax        char
                A maximum matlab version that can be used
 
    VersionArch        'any' | '32' | '64'
                The matlab version architecture to be used. "Any" means any architecture can be used.

    ForceMatlabSearch   boolean
                Do we force the automated search of Matlab ?
                In the default behavior, this is set to false. The selection script will try to search Matlab
                only if a MatlabWorkerConfiguration.xml cannot be found on the host. If the script finds some Matlab instances
                it will create a new MatlabWorkerConfiguration.xml to speed up latter executions.
                If on the contrary ForceMatlabSearch is set to true, the selection script will always search the disk for
                Matlab installations.

    Priority          'Idle' | 'Lowest' | 'Low' | 'Normal' | 'High' | 'Highest'
                Priority used by default for jobs submitted with PAsolve,
                default to 'Normal'

    UseJobClassPath
                With this options set to true, the toolbox will use the jobClassPath feature of the scheduler, when submitting jobs
                jar files necessary to the matlab workers will be copied at each task execution. It will not be necessary to put the
                jars in the addons directory, but it will introduce an overhead

    WindowsStartupOptions   char
                Options given to matlab worker processes started on windows operating systems

    LinuxStartupOptions     char
                Options given to matlab worker processes started on linux operating systems

    CustomScript
                url or path of a user-defined selection script used in
                addition to (before) FindMatlabScript and MatlabReservationScript

    CustomScriptStatic
                a boolean, true if the CustomScript is a static one
                (executed only once on a given machine), otherwise the
                CustomScript will be dynamic (default)

    CustomScriptParams
                a string containing the parameters of the custom script
                delimited by spaces.

    FindMatlabScript and FindMatSciScriptStatic
                url or path of selection script used to find matlab

                tokens (internal)

    ProActiveJars, EmbeddedJars and WorkerJars
                Comma separated list of jar files used by ProActive
                (internal)

                path to log4j configuration file (internal)

    SecurityFile
                path to java security configuration file (internal)
